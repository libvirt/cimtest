This directory is where domain components should be put to facilitate
test domain creation in cimtest.  The following conventions are
expected:

  default-xen-kernel: This is a kernel (or link to a kernel) image
                      that is runnable on the current system's Xen
  default-xen-initrd: This is a valid initrd for the disk image, which
                      may include modules specific to the above kernel
  default-xen-dimage: This is a valid disk image that will be
                      connected to xvda, and may require bootable
                      components (depending on the contents of the
                      initrd)

A sample set of the above three files can be built by running "make"
in this directory.  The Xen xm-test ramdisk image will be fetched from
XenSource, and the default xen kernel on the system will be used.  An
empty disk image will be created, although it is not used by the
ramdisk.
